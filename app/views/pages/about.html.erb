<h1>About</h1>
<p style="color:#7f8c8d;">Invitely is an online web service where you can create digital wedding invitations to send to your guests. Save time, money, and the environment!</p>
<p style="color:#7f8c8d;">In 2013, I was getting married and was in charge of planning a wedding for 600 guests (I'm Indian, what did you expect). With some guests coming from out of town, and others spread all over BC, the task of sending out wedding invitations became overwhelming. Especially since I'm a perfectionist who wanted to design and print my own wedding invitations. 
<p style="color:#7f8c8d;">As my wedding day came closer and closer, I realized I hadn't left myself enough time to actually deliver the invitations. So I did what any saavy web developer in my position would do. I created an online web page with all of our wedding details. I even included a pre-wedding photo gallery, and a little bit about my wife and myself. I apprehensively sent it to my friends through Facebook and Email, and the response was amazing! Everyone loved it, and more imporatantly, everyone came to the wedding festivities! Since then, many of my friends have been asking me to create digital wedding invitiations for them as well, so I decided to turn my idea into a web app that anyone could use.</p>
<p style="color:#7f8c8d;">Please send me any feedback you may have, as I'd like this to be a useful service for everyone. In the future, I would love to add the ability to create invitations for all sorts of events. Thanks for visiting my site, talk to you soon!</p>
